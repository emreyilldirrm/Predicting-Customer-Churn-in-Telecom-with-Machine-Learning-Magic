# Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom Using Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview
In this project, we explore customer churn prediction for a telecommunications company using the **WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn** dataset. By leveraging machine learning algorithms like **CatBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **CART**, we aim to understand which factors contribute most to customer churn and create a predictive model to help mitigate customer loss.

## Objective
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are at risk of churn. Understanding churn drivers can help the business take proactive steps to improve customer retention.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**: Conducted a detailed examination of features, missing values, and distributions.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Normalized numerical features where necessary.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identified key features affecting churn.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Applied three machine learning algorithms (CatBoost, Random Forest, and CART).
   - Evaluated models based on accuracy, F1-score, and AUC.
